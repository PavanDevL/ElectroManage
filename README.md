# ElectroManage: Streamlining Energy Efficiency
  There is a demand for electrical energy to support this rapidly expanding Society as the digital era develops with new Technology. The use of natural resources by a human is intrinsically linked to the use of energy, as a significant amount of natural resources are used to generate electrical energy. In order to track this energy usage everyday, there is a need for a well-organized and efficient system.  Utilization of energy has significantly increased. The misuse of natural resources by a human as a result of this leads to insufficient use of such resources.
  Modern energy monitoring tools offer real-time information on electricity consumption. With this quick input, customers and businesses may spot inefficiencies, trends, and optimisation opportunities right away. People are more likely to choose to use less energy and lower consumption when they can see how they use electricity.
### In This Machine Learning model
This model utilizes the Random Forest Classifier model to forecast the electricity consumption, determining whether it surpasses the previous consumption or not. The model is trained on a substantial dataset comprising the daily electricity consumption in Bangalore and its neighboring regions for the year 2022. It exhibits an accuracy of 88% and a precision of 90%.
